    Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.

      The chains that keeps us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties 
      about the future, ambitions for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own importance.

    Freedom is being able to do what one wishes and desires without any restrains or not under the control of another.
